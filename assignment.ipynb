    "**What is the ask?**  Implement a three-axis accelerometer using Serial Peripheral Interconnect communications and an interrupt-driven driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this important?** This lab brings together topics you have covered over the past month of the course to build, debug, and verify a complete system.  While your activities in this lab are still guided, you are given less support than in prior labs.  This is intentional.  You have been developing critical skills for embedded system code development, hardware prototyping, software debugging, and hardware troubleshooting.  It is time to put them to use building a practical sensor that has been the starting point for multiple commercial products.    \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: I will build your code.  Make sure your code does not generate any warnings when it builds!  The penalty for code that generates warnings when it compiles is severe: 10% off!  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a partner-based lab but I expect you to develop, maintain, and submit individual repos.  You can submit the same code, or sit side by side and develop \"highly similar\" code, but where possible I ask you to provide your own (individual) code comments (more on commenting in a second).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Where I ask you for *INDIVIDUAL RESPONSE*, however, you should answer on your own based on your own individual work/thinking.  I expect you and your partner to both implement the hardware design.  Where things go wrong with hardware I would like you to first try and troubleshoot it yourself, then work collaboratively with your partner to sort it out. \n",
    "\n",
    "I haven't yet gone around the room and asked you to explain your code or your hardware to me.  Be prepared for this over the next few weeks.  Don't rely on your partner's work if you do not understand it!\n",
    "\n",
    "I *encourage* the use of AI to generate code.  Even if the code it generates works, so far what I have seen of AI-generated code will get a C from me because it is poorly commented, uses magic numbers, does not reference source documenation, and does not provide any/adequate comments about design decisions.  Use AI (or don't), but *cite* your use of it, bring it to an 'A' standard, and make sure you understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commenting: comments are where you convince me you understand what is going on... and (very) well commented code may even save you from having to explain it to me real-time!  We've gone over this quite a bit the last few weeks, so I shouldn't have to remind you... but remind you I will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set expectations for your code reviewer (e.g. me!) before functions.  Describe the objective, any algorithms, input arguments, return values...\n",
    "* As you implement your function, indicate where you are meeting expectations (before the function \"in this function I will (1), (2), (3)\"... inside of the function \"here I implement (1)... here I implement (2)...\"\n",
    "* No magic numbers!  Use #define or, if you must use magic, explain it in a comment\n",
    "* Any time you make a design decision, write it down.  If you go left, explain why you go left and why you did not go right!  \n",
    "* When messing with registers, and anywhere else that it makes sense: provide a reference to the source document, document section, etc. that explains the register / the behavior resulting from changes you are making\n",
    "\n",
    "When in doubt, ask me for clarification.  That said, this should be a very fun lab... let's get started."

    "First up - which STM32F042K6-Nucleo dev board and LIS3DH dev board pins are you going to connect together?  You are constrained by the pins available on the STM32F042K6-Nucleo dev board.  Remember where to find alternate functions for pins?  Combine this information to figure out which pins on the STM32F042K6 you *must* use for SPI communications.  Fill out the table below as you sort this out.  I've put in the USART2_TX signal information as an example of the format I am looking for.  I would also take a note on which alternate function values you want - you'll need to know that when you configure the pins for SPI later.\n",

I don't usually do this, but sometimes it works out.  It might work out in this lab... it might not.  You can defer making this decision by using the SPI peripheral's \"NSS\"-capable pin for chip select, and deciding later if you want to manage it manually as GPIO (digital output mode) or as SPI Peripheral Hardware NSS (alternate function mode).  \n",

    "\n",
    "Your goal in this section is to configure the accelerometer to take high-resolution (12-bit) X,Y,Z acceleration measurements at 10 Hz.  The accelerometer has its own internal timer, so you do not need to start these acceleration measurements each time (like you did with the analog to digital converter in the last lab).  Instead, you need to configure the accelerometer.  The accelerometer is an \"off-chip\" peripheral (it is attached to the chip; it is not a peripheral inside of the chip).  But, just like on-chip peripherals, the accelerometer has configuration and status registers.  You interact with these registers over the SPI bus.\n",

    "NOTE WELL: The LIS3DH accelerometer is not reset when you reset the STM32F042K6 microcontroller (using the debugger or the board's reset button).  The LIS3DH accelerometer's register values will remain unchanged through microcontroller resets unless you disconnect power to the board.  It is a common debugging \"gotcha\" to flip the \"wrong\" bit in e.g. an accelerometer's configuration registers, then fix your microcontroller code to flip the \"right\" bit but to forget to reset the accelerometer to clear the \"wrong bit\" by fully de-powering the board.  When in doubt, unplug the board.  Also note that you cannot necessarily get away with just disconnecting the LIS3DH's Vdd supply (by removing the jumper temporarily).  there are a number of IO pins connected the LIS3DH that may be at 3.3V, and just disconnecting Vdd may not sufficiently de-power the acceleromter enough to reset it (and may actually create more problems partially-powering it via an IO pin).  so, again, when in doubt: unplug the board to reset everything!"

    "\n",
    "In this week's lab you built a three axis accelerometer using a layered, interrupt driven design.  You worked with the common Serial Peripheral Interconnect (SPI) bus to connect external sensors the the microcontroller and EXTI capabilities to enable external devices to interrupt the microcontroller.  You likely spent time using the Analog Discovery 3's logic analyzer and protocol analyzer capabilities to understand, debug, and verify your systems behaviors along the way.  These are practical skills that I use regularly in design work in industry.  Well done!\n",
