Fork this repo to your Dartmouth GitHub account, then clone your copy of the repo to your ENGS-62 workspace on your personal computer.  

***Be sure you are cloning your copy of the repo, and not the main course repo! You will not be able to save/submit your work if you clone the main course repo:***

OSX: open terminal and change into your ENGS-62-workspace folder (mine is in my Documents folder under ENGS-62-workspace)

Win: open "git bash" and change into your ENGS-62-workspace folder 
```
cd ~/Documents/ENGS-62-workspace/
git clone git@github.com:<githubid>/W26-W3-LA.git
```
Note that this lab does not require python.  You may skip the python intialization steps, but it does no harm to perform them if you do.

You can now launch VSCode and open the W26-W5-LA folder.  

Be sure to install any recommended VSCode extensions (a recommendations box will pop up within the first 30-60 seconds after opening VSCode if any extensions are recommended).

Begin by opening the assignment.ipynb file
